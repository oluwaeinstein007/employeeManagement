## Thoughts

## Thoughts

### Scalability

1. **Large File Processing**: For processing exceptionally large files, I'd consider saving them on the backend and queuing them for background processing job. This approach ensures timely user notifications and email notifications upon completion.

2. **Uniqueness Validation**: I'd implement a validation check to ensure the uniqueness of employee IDs (Emp_ID) to prevent duplicate entries.

3. **Employee Record Updates**: I'd create an endpoint to update employee records via a CSV file. This endpoint should only modify existing employee data and relevant fields.

4. **Cloud Hosting**: I'd explore cloud hosting for automated scaling and resource management, enhancing performance and availability.

5. **Caching with Redis**: I'd utilize Redis to cache responses from the "get all employees" and "get employee by id" endpoints for performance enhancement by reducing database queries.

### Security

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Iâ€™d implement Authentication and Authorization for Admin and Staff, then a middleware/permission group to enforce it

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: I'd enhance security with 2FA to protect against breaches.

3. **Secure Data Handling**: I'd prioritize secure storage and encryption of sensitive data.

4. **CDN for Protection**: Use a CDN like Cloudflare to safeguard against DDoS attacks and enhance loading times.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and unauthorized access.
